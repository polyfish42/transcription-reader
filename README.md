# YouTube Transcriber

Live Site: [https://youtube-transcription.herokuapp.com/](https://youtube-transcription.herokuapp.com/)

YouTube Transcriber was built to make watching long talks more efficient. It will create a transcript from the captions that are searchable and can be clicked to skip to their time stamp. It's really useful for finding that one part of the talk you liked.

It works by scraping the captions off the actual YouTube page, and building a transcription from the different available captions.
